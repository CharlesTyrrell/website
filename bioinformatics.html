<h5>Coursework from The University of Alaska, Anchorage </h5>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
</div>
<em>Our curriculum is focused mainly on the steps of the bioinformatic pipeline </em>

<p>Below is a list of links and documents of assignments I have worked on in class</p>
<ul>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: -3%;">

<li><b><u><a href="documents/Bioinformatics 455, for website PS5.pdf">Phylogenetic Trees</a></u></b></li>
</div>
<div><em>In this assignment we were tasked with identifying and creating a phylogenetic tree for five unknown 16S rRNA sequences 

</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> 
  <li><b><u><a href="documents/Bioinformatics 455, for website PS9-converted.pdf">16S rRNA isolation and alignment</a></u></b></li>
</div>
<div><em>In this assignment we were tasked with isolating the 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from an unknown sequence,
  finding the closest organism, and detailing any gaps in the genome between the unknown and closest related 
  genome.

</em>

</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> 
  <li><b><u><a href="documents/Bioinformatics Final Paper.docx">OTU creation and analysis</a></u></b></li>
</div>
<div><em>In this independent project, I decided to investigate the potential for a shared trait among HIV subtypes
  in Africa that contribute to the high rate of infection across the continent. To do this, I downloaded sequences 
  representing the HIV envelope gene from the HIV database, and clustered 
  them into OTUs using vsearch. I then imported the data into R to visualized the OTUs based on location and subtype. 
  If clustering based on location was observed more than clustering based on subtype within the African continent then 
  it was likely that there was shared genetic trait within the envelope gene of African HIV subtypes.
